# OFScripts

This is a repository of the automated systems I use to enhance OmniFocus. If you find errors or would like to contribute to these, feel free to send me a pull request.

# Auto-Parser

This is a launch agent designed to automatically parse the inbox of OmniFocus behind the scenes. You can email into OmniFocus and have it automatically parsed into the correct project and context. It can even have due dates, defer dates, flags, and estimated time.

To use it, you simply need to create a string that is to be parsed and pass it to the OmniFocus inbox. You can learn more about creating the string for this [here](http://joebuhlig.com/using-omnifocus-for-somedaymaybe-lists/).

# Update Reviews

If that flag beside the Review perspective drives you crazy, this is for you. You can set dates for your scheduled reviews and move the Next Review Date of each project forward to the next instance of your reviews. You can learn more about it [here](http://joebuhlig.com/scheduled-reviews-in-omnifocus/).
